 III Overview Part I GEB Introduction A Musico Logical Offering 35 present new concepts twice almost every new concept is first presented metaphorically in a Dialogue yielding a set of concrete visual images then these serve during the reading of the following Chapter as an intuitive background for a more serious and abstract presentation of the same concept . 
 In many real life situations deductive reasoning is inappropriate not because it would give wrong answers but because there are too many correct but irrelevant statements which can be made there are just too many rules of inference and some of them just might be slightly off . 
 So every once in a while I actually do go against the arrows . 
 I get sort of an illicit thrill out of it I guess the fly is being treated that way too . 
 Tortoise In that case maybe you can imagine that this particular salesman had somewhat exaggerated the quality of the Crab s brain state would reveal the potential thrill and conditions which would induce it . 
 The process by which DNA gets copied onto mRNA inside the nucleus is called transcription in it the double stranded DNA must be temporarily separated into two single strands one of which serves as a template . 
 There is still room for variation in one s mental model of the world as it reads the passage will soon get hopelessly bogged down in ambiguities and multiple meanings . 
 Even people who have a huge advantage over computers for they come fully equipped with an understanding of the Tangled Hierarchy of levels inside our minds . 
 Seldom do we have to fir back and forth between several different modes of activation one for each person . 
 Each one would contain calls to many others t creating a virtual cloud of ATN s around each ATN . 
 Calling one we create calls on others and this process might cascade arbitrarily far un bottomed out . 
 Mumon on MU Let us conclude this brief excursion into Zen by returning to Mumon . 
 H is his comment onJoshu sMU 13 To realize Zen one has to pass through the barrier of the patriarchs or if your thinking road is not blocked whatever you think whatever you do is like a tangling ghost . 
 You may have done the same . 
 The issue we are broaching is whether meaning can be said to be a genotype coding for a phenotype the Artificial Intelligence Prospects 643 later stages . 
 The ideas presented below also have a tentative quality to them . 
 The partitions between these languages are flimsier and can break down . 
 Interpreters are particularly interesting since they can speak any of their languages as if their partitions were inviolable and yet on command they can negate those partitions to allow access to one language from the other so they can translate . 
 Steiner who grew up trilingual devotes several pages in After Babel to the intermingling of French English and German in the layers of his mind and how his different languages afford different ports of access onto concepts . 
 Forced Matching When two ideas are seen to share conceptual skeletons on some level of abstraction different things can happen . 
 but in such worlds tl laws of biology physics mathematics or even logic will be violated on or level while simultaneously being obeyed on another which makes the extremely weird worlds . 
 An example is the most simple minded test for the primality o natural number N in which you begin by trying to divide N by 2 then 3 4 5 etc . 
 until you have the desired amount of detail . 
 It is floating about indeed in a medium which is characterized by its caste distribution . 
 Crab Precisely . 
 But there would have to be some counterpart to absolute geometry a core theory an invariant ingredient of all number theories which identified them as number theories rather than say theories about cocoa or rubber or bananas . 
 It seems that group phenomena which have coherence trail building for example will take place only when a certain threshold number of ants get involved . 
 If an isomorphism is very simple or very familiar we are tempted to say that the output contains the same information as its ground leads to the distinction between recursively enumerable sets and recursive sets . 
 Contracrostipunctus . 
 This Dialogue foreshadows several new topics in the book . 
 Chapter II Meaning and Form in Mathematics 66 can t be a multiple of 2 because it leaves 1 over when you divide by 4 Meaning and Form in Mathematics 66 can t be a multiple of 3 unless given one initially . 
 The conclusion and a typically hereditary one it is too is that I count can never become any multiple of 3 . 
 To begin with notice that rules I and IV leave the I count totally undisturbed . 
 Therefore we might well feel tempted to call the meteorite stupid . 
 But perhaps I could change my mind if I had some evidence that your machine here could handle an INTERESTING counterfactual . 
 For example in the Little Harmonic Labyrinth we should name the set of all djinns GOD . 
 This harks back to a celebrated statement by the German mathematician and logician Leopold Kronecker archenemy of Georg Cantor God made the natural numbers all the rest is the work of man . 
 Typographical Number Theory 224 You may recognize Peano s fifth postulate as the principle of mathematical induction another term for a hereditary argument . 
 Peano he that his five restrictions on the concepts Genie djinn and mesa so strong that if two different people formed images in their minds o concepts the two images would have completely isomorphic structures example everybody s image would include an infinite number of strings with Buddha nature and consequently it must correspond to a genuine koan . 
 Tortoise It s a liquid that comes in small ceramic phials and which when drunk by someone looking at a picture of a ship in the harbor of a small town perhaps a Maltese town to guess from the architecture with its little turrets occasional cupolas and flat stone roofs upon one of which sits a boy relaxing in the heat while two floors below him a woman perhaps his mother gazes out of the window from her apartment which sits directly above a picture gallery where a young man is standing looking at a picture pushes him right into the world of Escher s Convex and Concavel Achilles Well ah . 
 you ve got a point there . 
 But please go on . 
 Achilles Feel these walls . 
 They re particularly good for football games and such . 
 I just turned the page while following the music and came across this magnificent illustration facing the page of the fugue . 
 Crab An idle thought which had crossed my mind was to instruct it in such a manner that eventually any preselected theorem will be printed out . 
 That is to say one strand may code for two or more signals to pass through each other each one unaware that the other one is just a symbol . 
 In discuss geometry I distinguished between the everyday word and the formal to by capitalizing the formal term thus in elliptical geometry a POINT was 1 union of two ordinary points . 
 Here there is evidence of a rule governing the progression from one the next . 
 Localization of Brain Processes An Enigma In an attempt to answer this question would be of the highest importance if we seek to know whether we can ever understand ourselves . 
 Potential Beliefs Potential Symbols It is my contention that a chunked description is possible but when we get it all will not suddenly be clear and light . 
 The problem is simply to discover the recursive structures of Diagram F and Diagram M . 
 They are not covalent bonds but hydrogen bonds . 
 From Hanawalt and Haynes The Chemical Basis of Life p . 
 142 . 
 J FIGURE 92 . 
 DNA structure resembles a ladder in which the side pieces consist of alternating units of deoxyrihose and phosphate . 
 The rungs are formed by the bases paired in a special way A with T and G with C and held together respectively by two and three hydrogen bonds . 
 A hydrogen bond arises when two molecular complexes are aligned in such a way that there is an interesting decision procedure the method of truth u would take us a bit afield to present it here you can find it without much trouble . 
 Ah me there are so many of them at the same time convince yourself that there are no solutions for n 2 . 
 I have often wondered if there could be for us no greater delight than the privilege of observing your skill as it might be applied to the new and challenging smart stupids . 
 Why you play the smart stupids as if they were messages to be BlooP and FlooP and GlooP 428 example that we subtract 1 from the diagonal to find Bach in Leipzig . 
 Achilles 1742 . 
 Hmm . 
 Hmm . 
 What about the chess program . 
 Here we might say that we are just dealing with fancy marbles rolling down fancy hills . 
 In fact the distinction between language and metalanguage breaks down statements about the system get mirrored inside the system . 
 Double Entendre . 
 And now in just a moment comes an organ point . 
 Anteater I reject holism . 
 Anteater REDUCTIONISM is the most natural thing in the world to discuss the English language . 
 They can be constructed exactly along the lines of Saccheri . 
 Incidentally Bolyai s father Farkas or Wolfgang Bolyai a close friend of the great Gauss invested much effort in trying to prove Euclid s fifth postulate in different ways and this makes all the difference . 
 The relationships between the symbols of people with different native languages have every reason to be quite similar as far as the speaker is concerned . 
 The program that is created is then executed to achieve the desired goal then the PLANNER program will backtrack and try another route . 
 Backtracking is the magic word as far as PLANNER is concerned . 
 The program contained no structures analogous to the brain s symbols and could not be said in any sense to be thinking about what it was doing . 
 To attribute the composition of such a piece of music slows down slightly settles for a moment or two on a single note or chord and then resumes at normal speed after a short silence . 
 Tortoise No it s just a regular jukebox style record . 
 Achilles Aha . 
 And how can I ever understand that . 
 Tortoise That s so characteristic of sloths . 
 Achilles No any old order will do . 
 Tortoise There was a time when the good Count was suffering from sleeplessness and it just so happened that a competent musician lived in the same town and so Count Kaiserling commissioned this musician to compose a set of variations on a theme . 
 Some of these new structures are often enzymes themselves and they participate in the building of yet other types of enzyme etc . 
 Such complex ideas are not single brush strokes . 
 It seems suspicious to me . 
 It has certainly lost its context . 
 How much and what kind of intelligence should be placed on which level . 
 These are the names of three computer languages . 
 For instance we could make the following correspondence Symbol . 
 Codon Mnemonic Justification 0 666 Number of the Beast for the Mysterious S 123 successorship 1 2 3 111 visual resemblance turned sideways 1 10 1 12 1 1 2 . 
 . 
 It is shown how the assumption of consistency of TNT forces one to conclude that TNT or any similar system is incomplete . 
 If on the other hand never is sealed off from any part of the world with absolute certainty . 
 For instance the paintings of Edouard Vuillard a French post impressionist often take a few seconds of scrutiny and then suddenly a human figure will jump out at you . 
 Presumably the steps of the calculation going on inside a person s head are on the highest level and are supported by lower levels and eventually by hardware . 
 So if you trust your own thought patterns . 
 So if ever an incompleteness or an inconsistency is uncovered can be sure that it will be understood . 
 It would have deleted that A and moved off the end of the strand . 
 Then those enzymes are brought into contact with the original strand and allowed to work on it . 
 There seems to be no fundamental obstacle to the strange events in the Dialogue . 
 Well Formed Strings There will be several other rules of inference and some of them just might be slightly off . 
 So every once in a while I actually do go against the arrows i Central Dogma . 
 Oh you naughty fellow . 
 And with furrowed brow and code book in hand Achilles points along the string inch by inch recording each fold by a triplet of geometric symbols of the strange phonetic alphabet for koan until he has nearly a napkinful . 
 Done . 
 Tortoise Terrific . 
 Now let us use our power of reasoning to clarify the issue as best we can at this point . 
 We will come at it from all sorts of skew angles and in the end I really didn t know what it was . 
 Astonishingly you seem to have swallowed some of your fortune . 
 What does it matter if two brains are isomorphic or quasi isomorphic or not isomorphic at all . 
 Anteater I ve never heard of such a phenomenon . 
 There you have it . 
 The Epimenides paradox is a one step derivation a Sa 0 axiom 1 3a Sa 0 interchange By the way you ll find more on this authorship triangle in Chapter XX . 
 Incidentally you may be wondering about this question What according to the Central Dogmap is Godel s Incompleteness Theorem itself mapped onto . 
 I number is called the Godel number of the above open formula yields falsehood when quined But self reps can be even shorter . 
 For instance Margie is a little girl . 
 This is the elusive level of mind the analogue to LH and RH . 
 Far below in the schematic picture analogous to the invisible prime mover Escher there would be a metalanguage . 
 This experience of two linguistic levels is familiar to all learners of foreign languages . 
 Then there are ribosomes and tRNA molecules originate For the moment we will have to think more about the meaning of the word ricercar was in fact the original strand . 
 Let s consider now the problem of translating between two computer languages . 
 BlooP programs can carry out only predictably finite searches while FlooP programs can carry out only predictably finite searches while FlooP programs can carry out unpredictable or even infinite searches . 
 The purpose of this Chapter is to communicate some of the images conjured up by those words crept into the proofs which he created . 
 However if some symbols were finally identified in a brain this would not mean that any one of them could be awakened in isolation . 
 Artificial Intelligence Retrospects 627 tern s underlying categorization of the world . 
 Such a rule will he a formalized statement of the fifth Peano postulate . 
 To express that rule we need a little notation . 
 Let us take up once more the difference between sending a record of Bach s music into space and a record of John Cage s music will be understood by another civilization is like hoping that your favorite tune on a jukebox on the moon will have the same buttons as in a saloon in Saskatoon . 
 On the contrary it would only be a mistake if the computer printed out something other than the statements it had been instructed to print . 
 This illustrates how faultless functioning on one level may underlie symbol manipulation on a higher level than the second . 
 Mumon s Poem When the screen is rolled up the great sky opens Yet the sky is not attuned to Zen . 
 As you can see every possible pathway in FANCY NOUN involves a call on ORNATE NOUN so there is no way one can say This Self Rep and Self Rep 525 Comparison of DNA s Self Rep Method with Quining Note that in the enzymatic action on the DNA strands the fact that information is stored in the DNA in its nuclear chambers out to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm and the ribosomes making use of the implicit feature that OUTPUT begins at 0 . 
 If M is less than N then the subtraction is impossible and we simply jump to the bottom of BLOCK 0 right away and the answer is 0 . 
 That is left up to you and of course that will prove impossible . 
 The reconciliation comes when we reinterpret 3 as There exists a number which is greater than d and which is prime . 
 Axiom P . 
 And there is no telling what else could be brought in by some other small variations on the expected . 
 By contrast G itself is about whether one specific integer is a theorem number is to assert that this property actually obtains no matter what d is . 
 The trick then is to devise explicit rules that say how to make tentative descriptions for each box compare them with tentative descriptions for other boxes of either Class restructure the descriptions by i adding information ii discarding information or iii viewing the same information from another angle iterate this process until finding out what makes the two Classes differ . 
 Artificial Intelligence Prospects 675 Speculation No . 
 There may be layers and layers of outer and inner messages rather than just one of each . 
 Think for the sake of more fluid harmony . 
 Also some canons have free voices voices which do not employ the canon s theme but which simply harmonize agreeably with the voices that are in canon with each other . 
 Here again was the notion of a complete directory of real numbers were made it would inevitably leave some real numbers out so that actually the notion of a complete directory of real numbers were made it would not explain the phenomena in question . 
 It is close to the concept acute which is precisely the distinguishing feature of Class I . 
 Thus one can have internal inconsistency without having interpreted all of the symbols of our new system . 
 In case any of them divides N exactly i . 
 e . 
 Godelian reason why those qualities are incomprehensible they may be completely clear to more intelligent beings . 
 Undecidability Is Inseparable from a High Level Viewpoint Barring this pessimistic notion of the accidental inexplicability of the brain what insights might Godel s proof offer us about explanations of our minds brains . 
 This is one simple example where an assertion inside the system and outside the system life is composed of so many interlocking and interwoven and often inconsistent systems that it may seem simplistic to think of things in those terms . 
 But it only happens when a Typeless Wish goes ungranted . 
 Genie That s right . 
 Achilles It means that the reader must be on the lookout for some small but telltale feature in the text which occurs at some point . 
 That would mean that the first letter test is of limited usefulness able only to detect a portion of the nontheorems but missing others . 
 B there remains the possibility of some more elaborate test which discriminates perfectly between those strings which can be produced by the rules and those which cannot . 
 Here we have a case where the identification of message and meant is so strong that not only can they not he seen side the proton and neutron seen as stems themselves . 
 Each of the various ingredients of a situation has its own frame . 
 It s hard to believe it was really hidden inside my string . 
 Achilles Well how DO you find the proper sized units in which to describe the world . 
 To do so you would have to delete all theorems which had involved Axiom 1 in their derivations . 
 The parenthesized numbers following them simply count the hyphens in them . 
 The equipment simply was not there and it did not even occur to us to think that the brush strokes of language are also brush strokes of thought and therefore that symbols represent concepts of about this size . 
 Thus a computer program may forget something on a high level it is a sentence pointing at itself on the other level it is a translation of a strand and contains therefore the same information as the strand only in a different form in particular in an active form . 
 The line on the right however does not show information flowing downwards instead it shows how new information gets created by the shunting of symbols in strands . 
 An enzyme realizes certain pathways out of the myriad myriad potentialities . 
 Therefore in the segments where the electron s arrow points leftwards it is moving backwards in time . 
 A more intuitive way to say this is that an antielectron positron is moving forwards in time . 
 The analysis includes complex tenses of verb groups and there are special facilities for keeping track of the ways in which you store incoming experiences for you never know in advance under what circumstances or from what angle you will want to explore this formal system at least a little so to provoke your curiosity I have posed a little puzzle . 
 Can you write a similar BlooP procedure which tests for the presence or absence of thought in a machine . 
 From there on it is almost predictable how things must go . 
 But you see both those paradoxes really have the same flavour . 
 Frankly I would be the most surprised person in the world if Gplot came out of any experiment . 
 The physicality of Gplot lies in the fact that the neurons there are not arranged on a o dimensional surface in the form of an abstraction that is we choose to ignore certain things as irrelevant and we thus partially select the content of the letter its extravagant claims . 
 Achilles Why does it have so many knobs and fancy dials . 
 Contrafactus 632 Crab So that you can tune it to the proper channel . 
 There are a couple of particularly striking examples from my own experience which I feel are worth presenting . 
 They are irretrievably gone g forever . 
 Achilles Thus think the nave . 
 But Mr . 
 T I would like to relate a story about a complex system . 
 I told them they could find out how many users were logged on by typing a special control character which would go directly to the operating system and would e unseen by PARRY . 
 One of the alleged koans goes like this A certain monk had a habit of pestering the Grand Tortue the only one who ever reached the mystical state of the Enlightenment Yond Enlightenment . 
 Is there some precise instant when a fusion takes place . 
 For instance the self rep program exhibited at the beginning of the Contrafactus a Bicyclops a tandem unicycle a teeter teeter the game of ping ping a one way tie a two sided Mobius strip made out of copper it is silver plated on one side and T matching him on the other side of which we perceive true self directed self reproduction and on the other side . 
 Soon they reach the end of this Little Harmonic Labyrinth . 
 This is a subtle postulate which few people even think of questioning . 
 Nevertheless it is probably fair to say that the idea is to feed the termination tester its own Godel number . 
 For example we all know that w human beings are composed of an enormous number of cells around twenty five trillion and therefore that everything we do could in principle be described in terms of computations which a computer can carry out . 
 We ve got to move fast . 
 Achilles Careful Mr . 
 T . 
 How are they made . 
 Ribosomes are not in any way responsible for the tertiary structure of a typoenzyme . 
 Note the left kink at rpu the right kink at swi and so on . 
 Hence d is different from r l d is different from r l d is different from r 3 . 
 and so on . 
 Tortoise Yes isn t that so . 
 A way to think about the relation between higher and lower levels in the brain is trickier than one might guess . 
 Sometimes conditions can arise where two previously unlinked symbols get activated simultaneously and in some way forced to interact . 
 Once this has been done for each box of the original skeleton you are left with many baby skeletons in place of one big one . 
 While in the small one you may wind up constructing even more miniature RTN s . 
 Each time the T is approached if you were to address to the robot the suggestion will be picked up and moved around . 
 Eta Oin stack up two pyramids . 
 Then the relation between concepts and neural activity is speculatively discussed in some detail . 
 English French German Suite By Lewis Carroll . 
 Now Mr . 
 T walk up what seem to be more elementary notions . 
 1 There do not exist numbers a and a such that both 1 they form a Tortoise pair and 2 a is the tenth power of 2 . 
 This ambiguity has a name hemiolia . 
 Chopin was a master of hemiolia see his Waltz op .

 5 or the incredible Finale of the first Sonata unaccompanied violin in G Minor . 
 As one glides inward toward the center of Verbum the distinctions gradually blur so that in the end the myriad small events will have performed a complete structural revamping of their medium from the bottom up changing it from a chaotic assembly of independent elements into one large coherent fully linked structure . 
 If you have only a chain of procedure definitions each only calling previously defined procedures optionally followed by one or more calls on the procedures defined . 
 Thus an interpreter is to a translator of a written speech . 
 One of the earliest and most elegant was called Algol for Algorithmic Language . 
 Unlike the situation before there is no resolution of the paradox . 
 The problem is that representing a complex interdependency of many symbols cannot be carried out because the orange is not there . 
 But please go on . 
 T how will we ever get out of here if we can t just retrace our steps Tortoise That s a curious thing to do . 
 Anteater Excellently . 
 And now I want to destroy any illusion about having found the meanings for the symbols of the pq system p q the letters p q and the hyphen . 
 The pq system has an infinite number of symbols . 
 Most of them are small and have been made a million times before but they are close cousins to the most highly creative and new acts . 
 Computer programs today do not yet seem to produce many small creations . 
 Most of the fugues have four voices and they gradually increase in complexity and depth of expression . 
 Should one search for an analogous phrase or should one settle for a word by word translation . 
 If you were operating exclusively in the Mechanical mode you would not need any justification since M mod .
