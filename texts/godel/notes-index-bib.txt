Bibliography 



The presence of two asterisks indicates that the hook or article was a prime 

motivator of my book. The presence of a single asterisk means that 

the book or article has some special feature or quirk which I want to single out. 

I have not given many direct pointers into technical literature; instead I have 
chosen to give "meta-pointers": pointers to books which have pointers to technical 
literature. 

Allen, John. The Anatomy of LISP. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1978. The most 
comprehensive book on LISP, the computer language which has dominated Artificial 
Intelligence research for two decades. Clear and crisp. 

Anderson, Alan Ross, ed. Minds and Machines. Englewood Cliffs, N. J.: PrenticeHall, 
1964. Paperback. A collection of provocative articles for and against Artificial 
Intelligence. Included are Turing's famous article "Computing Machines and 
Intelligence" and Lucas' exasperating article "Minds, Machines, and Godel". 

Babbage, Charles. Passages from the Life of a Philosopher. London: Longman, Green, 
1864. Reprinted in 1968 by Dawsons of Pall Mall (London). A rambling selection of 
events and musings in the life of this little-understood genius. There's even a play 
starring Turnstile, a retired philosopher turned politician, whose favorite musical 
instrument is the barrel-organ. I find it quite jolly reading. 

Baker, Adolph. Modern Physics and Anti-physics. Reading, Mass.: Addison- Wesley, 
1970. Paperback. A book on modern physics-especially quantum mechanics and 
relativity-whose unusual feature is a set of dialogues between a "Poet" (an antiscience 
"freak") and a "Physicist". These dialogues illustrate the strange problems which arise 
when one person uses logical thinking in defense of itself while another turns logic 
against itself. 

Ball, W. W. Rouse. "Calculating Prodigies", in James R. Newman, ed. The World of 
Mathematics, Vol. 1. New York: Simon and Schuster, 1956. Intriguing descriptions of 
several different people with amazing abilities that rival computing machines. 

Barker, Stephen F. Philosophy of Mathematics. Englewood Cliffs, N. J.: Prentice-Hall. 
1969. A short paperback which discusses Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry, and 
then Godel's Theorem and related results without any mathematical forms lism. 

* Beckmann, Petr. A History of Pi. New York: St. Martin's Press, 1976. Paperback. 
Actually, a history of the world, with pi as its focus. Most entertaining, as well as a 
useful reference on the history of mathematics. 

* Bell, Eric Temple. Men of Mathematics. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1965. 
Paperback. Perhaps the most romantic writer of all time on the history of mathematics. 
He makes every life story read like a short novel. Nonmathematicians can come away 
with a true sense of the power, beauty, and meaning of mathematics. 

Benacerraf, Paul. "God, the Devil, and Godel". Monist 51 (1967): 9. One of the most 
important of the many attempts at refutation of Lucas. All about mechanism and 
metaphysics, in the light of Godel's work. 

Benacerraf, Paul, and Hilary Putnam. Philosophy of Mathematics-Selected Readings. 
Englewood Cliffs, N. J.: Prentice-Hall, 1964. Articles by Godel, Russell, Nagel, von

Paperback. An incredible collection of some of the most bizarre and unbelievable 
wordplay in English. Palindromic poems, plays, stories, and so on. 

Bobrow, D. G., and Allan Collins, eds. Representation and Understanding: Studies in 
Cognitive Science. New York: Academic Press, 1975. Various experts on Artificial 
Intelligence thrash about, debating the nature of the elusive "frames", the question of 
procedural vs. declarative representation of knowledge, and so on. In a way, this book 
marks the start of a new era of Al: the era of representation. 

* Boden, Margaret. Artificial Intelligence and Natural Man. New York: Basic Books, 
1977. The best hook I have ever seen on nearly all aspects of Artificial Intelligence, 
including technical questions, philosophical questions, etc. It is a rich book, and in niv 
opinion, a classic. Continues the British tradition of clear thinking and expression on 
matters of mind, free will, etc. Also contains an extensive technical bibliography. 

. Purposive Explanation in Psychology. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 
1972. The book to which her Al book is merely- "an extended footnote", says Boden. 

* Boeke, Kees. Cosmic View: The Universe in 40 Jumps. New York: John Day, 1957. 
The ultimate book on levels of description. Everyone should see this book at some 
point in their life. Suitable for children. 

** Bongard, M. Pattern Recognition. Rochelle Park, N. J.: Hay den Book Co., Spartan 
Books, 1970. The author is concerned with problems of determining categories in an 
ill-defined space. In his book, he sets forth a magnificent collection of 100 "Bongard 
problems" (as I call them)-puzzles for a pattern recognizer (human or machine) to test 
its wits on. They are invaluably stimulating for anyone whoo is interested in the nature 
of intelligence. 

Boolos, George S., and Richard Jeffrey. Computability and Logic. New York: Cambridge 
University Press. 1974. A sequel to Jeffrey's Formal Logic. It contains a wide number 
of results not easily obtainable elsewhere. Quite rigorous, but this does not impair its 
readability. 

Carroll, John B., Peter Davies, and Barry Rickman. The American Heritage Word 
Frequency Book. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, and New York: American Heritage 
Publishing Co., 1971. A table of words in order of frequency in modern written 
American English. Perusing it reseals fascinating things about out- thought processes. 

Cerf, Vinton. "Parry Encounters the Doctor". Datamation, July 1973, pp. 62-64. The first 
meeting of artificial "minds"-what a shock! 

Chadwick, John. The Decipherment of Linear B. New York: Cambridge University 
Press, 1958. Paperback. A book about a classic decipherment-that of a script from the 
island of Crete-done by a single man: Michael Ventris. 

Chaitin, Gregory J. "Randomness and Mathematical Proof". Scientific American, May 
1975. An article about an algorithmic definition of randomness, and its intimate relation 
to simplicity. These two concepts are tied in with Godel's Theorem, which assumes a 
new meaning. An important article. 

Cohen, Paul C. Set Theory and the Continuum Hypothesis. Menlo Park, Calif: W. A. 
Benjamin, 1966. Paperback. A great contribution to modern mathematics-the 
demonstration that various statements are undecidable within the usual formalisms for

prerequisites in mathematical logic are quickly, concisely, and quite clearly presented. 
Cooke, Deryck. The Language of Music. New York: Oxford University Press, 1959. 
Paperback. The only book that I know which tries to draw an explicit connection 
between elements of music and elements of human emotion. A valuable start down 
what is sure to be a long hard road to understanding music and the human mind. 

* David, Hans Theodore. J. S. Bach's Musical Offering. New York: Dover Publications, 
1972. Paperback. Subtitled "History, Interpretation, and Analysis". A wealth of 
information about this tour de force by Bach. Attractively written. 

** David, Hans Theodore, and Arthur Mendel. The Bach Reader. New York: W. W. 
Norton, 1966. Paperback. An excellent annotated collection of original source material 
on Bach's life, containing pictures, reproductions of manuscript pages, many short 
quotes from contemporaries, anecdotes, etc., etc. 

Davis, Martin. The Undecidable. Hewlett, N. Y.: Raven Press, 1965. An anthology of 
some of the most important papers in metamathematics from 1931 onwards (thus quite 
complementary to van Heijenoort's anthology). Included are a translation of Godel's 
1931 paper, lecture notes from a course which Godel once gave on his results, and then 
papers by Church, Kleene, Rosser, Post, and Turing. 

Davis, Martin, and Reuben Hersh. "Hilbert's Tenth Problem". Scientific American, 
November 1973, p. 84. How a famous problem in number theory was finally shown to 
be unsolvable, by a twenty-two-year old Russian. 

** DeLong, Howard. A Profile of Mathematical Logic. Reading, Mass.: Addison- 
Wesley, 1970. An extremely carefully written book about mathematical logic, with an 
exposition of Godel's Theorem and discussions of many philosophical questions. One 
of its strong features is its outstanding, fully annotated bibliography. A book which 
influenced me greatly. 

Doblhofer, Ernst. Voices in Stone. New York: Macmillan, Collier Books, 1961. Paper 
back. A good hook on the decipherment of ancient scripts. 

* Drevfus, Hubert. What Computers Can't Do: A Critique of Artificial Reason. New 
YorkHarper & Roc-, 1972. A collection of many arguments against Artificial 
Intelligence from someone outside of the field. Interesting to try to refute. The Al 
community and Drevfus enjoy a relation of strong mutual antagonism. It is important to 
have people like Dreyfus around, even if you find them very irritating. 

Edwards, Harold M. "Fermat's Last Theorem". Scientific American, October 1978, pp. 
104-122. A complete discussion of this hardest of all mathematical nuts to crack, from 
its origins to the most modern results. Excellently illustrated. 

* Ernst, Bruno. The Magic Mirror of M. C. Escher. New York: Random House, 1976. 
Paperback. Escher as a human being, and the origins of his drawings, are discussed 
with devotion by a friend of mans' years. A "must" for any lover of Escher. 

** Escher, Maurits C, et al. The World of M. C. Escher. New York: Harry N. Abrarns, 
1972. Paperback. The most extensive collection of reproductions of Escher's works. 

Escher comes about as close as one can to recursion in art, and captures the spirit of 

Godel's Theorem in some of his drawings amazingly well, 
Feigenbaum, Edward, and Julian Feldman, eds. Computers and Thought. New York: 

McGraw-Hill, 1963. Although it is a little old now, this book is still an important

the existence of undecidable mathematical statements is suggested, though not 

rigorously demonstrated. 
Fitzpatrick, P. J. "To Godel via Babel"- Mind 75 (1966): 332-350. An innovative 

exposition of Godel's proof which distinguishes between the relevant levels by using 

three different languages: English, French, and Latin' 

* Gablik, Suzi. Magritte. Boston, Mass.: New York Graphic Society, 1976. Paperback. 
An excellent book on Magritte and his works by someone who really understands their 
setting in a wide sense; has a good selection of reproductions. 

* Gardner, Martin. Fads and Fallacies. New York: Dover Publications, 1952. Paperback. 
Still probably the best of all the anti-occult books. Although probably not intended as a 
book on the philosophy of science, this book contains many lessons therein. Over and 
over, one faces the question, "What is evidence?" Gardner demonstrates how 
unearthing "the truth" requires art as much as science. 

Gebstadter, Egbert B. Copper, Silver, Gold: an Indestructible Metallic Alloy. Perth: 
Acidic Books, 1979. A formidable hodge-podge, turgid and confused-yet remarkably 
similar to the present work. Professor Gebstadter's Shandean digressions include some 
excellent examples of indirect self-reference. Of particular interest is a reference in its 
well-annotated bibliography to an isomorphic, but imaginary, book. 

** Godel, Kurt. On Formally Undecidable Propositions. New York: Basic Books, 1962.

borderline between "the system" and "the world" is perceived and exploited and 
violated. 

Goldstein, Ira. and Seymour Papert. "Artificial Intelligence, Language, and the Study of 
Knowledge". Cognitive Science 1 (January 19/ 7): 84-123. A survey article concerned

"Romantic,., and "Modern". 

Guod, 1. 1. "Human and Machine Logic". British Journal for the Philosophy of Science In 
(196/): 144. One of the most interesting attempts to refute Lucas, having to do with 
whether the repeated application of the diagonal method is itself a mechanizable 
operation. 

. "Godel's Theorem is a Red Herring". British Journal for the Philosophy of Science 19 
(1969): 357. In which Good maintains that Lucas' argument has nothing to do with 
Godel's Theorem, and that Lucas should in fact have entitled his article "Minds, 
Machines, and Transfinite Counting". The Good-Lucas repartee is fascinating. 

Goodman, Nelson. Fact, Fiction, and Forecast. 3rd ed. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1973.

question of how humans perceive the world, and therefore interesting especially from 
the Al perspective.

• Hoare, C. A. R, and D. C. S. Allison. "Incomputability". Computing Surveys 4, 
no. 3 September 1972). A smoothly presented exposition of why the halting problem 
is unsolvable. Proves this fundamental theorem: "Any language containing 
conditionals and recursive function definitions which is powerful enough to program 
its own interpreter cannot be used to program its own 'terminates' function." 

• Hofstadter, Douglas R. "Energy levels and wave functions of Bloch electrons in

insightful. 

Hubbard, John I. The Biological Basis of Mental Activity. Reading, Mass.: 
AddisonWesley, 1975. Paperback. Just one more book about the brain, with one special 
virtue, however: it contains man long lists of questions for the reader to ponder, and 
references to articles which treat those questions. 

• Jackson. Philip C. Introduction to Artificial Intelligence. New York, Petrocelli Charter. 

1975. A recent book, describing, with some exuberance, the ideas of Al. There are a

it is very stimulating just to page through it. Has a giant bibliography, which is another 
reason to recommend it.

he brings up. 

• Jauch, J. M. Are Quanta Real? Bloomington, Ind.: Indiana University Press, 1973. A 
delightful little book of dialogues, using three characters borrowed from Galileo, put in 
a modern setting. Not only are questions of quantum mechanics discussed, but also 
issues of pattern recognition, simplicity, brain processes, and philosophy of science 
enter. Most enjoyable and provocative.

Westview Press, 1978. What seems at first an inconceivably hard idea-an optical 
illusion for four-dimensional "people" -is gradually made crystal clear, in an amazing 
virtuoso presentation utilizing a long series of excellently executed diagrams. The form 
of this article is just as intriguing and unusual as its content: it is tripartite on many 
levels simultaneously. This article and my book developed in parallel and each 
stimulated the other. 

Kleene, Stephen C. Introduction to Mathematical Logic. New York: John Wiley, 1967. A 
thorough, thoughtful text by an important figure in the subject. Very worthwhile. Each 
time I reread a passage, I find something new in it which had escaped me before.

something "emergent" about life. I am intrigued by books which seem wrong to me, yet 
in a hard-to-pin-down way.

human brain cannot, in principle, be modeled by a computer program. The argument is 
based entirely on Godel's Incompleteness Theorem, and is a fascinating one. The prose 
is (to my mind) 

incredibly infuriating-vet for that very reason, it makes humorous reading. "Satan

Anti-Benacerraf argument, written in hilariously learned style: at one point Lucas refers

genotype can be said, in any operational sense, to contain "all" the information about its 
phenotype. In other words, it is about the location of meaning in the genotype.
